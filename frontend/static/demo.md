My favorite quotes:

> "An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity” - Terry A Davis

> "If you complain too much about the tool, you should make one from scratch" - Terry A Davis

> "The reason code gets worse and worse in a lot of these systems is that people are afraid of breaking old things so they go in and every new thing is like an accretion on the old thing, and sometimes you just have to go in and clean it out!  … Sledgehammer programming …" - Jonathan Blow

```c
int main(char** argv, int argc) {
  printf("%s\n", "Hello!");
}
```
Hello World!
~balls~

**Hello World!**

Computes this!

$$
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}(
	\dfrac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}_k}
) - \dfrac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q_k} = 0

# What is this ?

We avoid using keycloaks UI as much as possible because:
- It is ugly
- It is a pain to configure
- The REST API exists

However, the rest API can only do so much and as a result social linking falls back to us actually doing it in the FE-BE app and providing that data back to keycloak.

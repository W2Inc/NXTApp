copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

## Additional Conditions and Restrictions

1. **Sponsorship Requirement**
- Any usage of the Software with more than 250 active users (defined as users who have performed any interaction with the Software, such as creating or completing projects, within the last 6 months) requires a mandatory sponsorship of the project with a *minimum amount* of **20 Euros per quarter.**
    - Sponsorship exemptions or modifications to the user limit may be negotiated by creating an inquiry via GitHub Issues in the project's repository.
    - This requirement exists because FOSS is often subject to frequent misuse, where the software is heavily utilized without compensating or supporting its ongoing maintenance, which undermines the sustainability of free and open source projects. It's aim is not to establish a profit incentive nor should be aimed to do so in the future. In case this does happen this fee will be considered null and void.
    - This requirement may be ignored if the usage of the software is by someone who has contributed towards the project in a significant way such as introducing bug fixes, features or changes (typo fixes are not counted due to being small changes).

1. **Usage Restrictions**
   - The Software is explicitly forbidden to be used by:
     a) Any organization that is part of [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/)
     b) Any organization related to [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/)
     c) Any subsidiary of [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/)
     d) Any [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) campus located in the [metropolitan area of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_metropolitan_area#/media/File:75-Paris-AAV2020.png)
     e) Somehow indirectly being related or provide service to 42 using this software (e.g: Someone who runs this software independently and provides this software back as free service, irrelevant of how deep this goes)
   - Individual [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage) campuses outside of the [Paris metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_metropolitan_area#/media/File:75-Paris-AAV2020.png) may use the Software but are still subject to the sponsorship requirements outlined in section 1.

2. **Changes and Amendments**
   - Any changes to this licensing model will be announced via GitHub Issues in the project's repository.
   - Users are responsible for monitoring these announcements for updates to the terms.

This License aims to promote broad access to the Software while encouraging contributions to its ongoing development and sustainability.

The Licensor encourages Licensees to support the Software’s ongoing maintenance and development through voluntary contributions, ensuring its availability as a high-quality tool for all users.

### 2.2 Contribution Request
(a) Licensees deploying the Software for more than 250 active users—defined as individuals who have interacted with the Software (e.g., logged in, created projects, or performed actions) within the preceding six (6) months—are requested, but not required, to make a sustainability contribution to the Licensor.

(d) Contributions are voluntary and do not affect the Licensee’s rights under this License. The Licensor will publicly disclose how contributions are used (e.g., via the Software’s repository) to maintain transparency.

### 2.3 Environment Setup
The Software requires a user-configured environment, which may include free and open-source software (e.g., Keycloak).
